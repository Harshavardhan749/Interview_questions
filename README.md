# Interview_questions
A set of basic interview questions for beginners and freshers to test their skill and to improve.
🧠 Beginner DSA & Logic Interview Prep
This repository is a curated collection of Data Structures, Algorithms, and Built-in Method explanations specifically for beginners. The goal is to move beyond "just memorizing" and start understanding the why behind the code.

🎯 What's Inside?
This repo focuses on the fundamental logic required for coding assessments and technical interviews.

1. Data Structures (The Basics)
Understanding how to store and organize data efficiently.
Arrays: Traversal, manipulation, and multidimensional arrays.
Strings: Common manipulation techniques and patterns.
Objects/Maps: Key-value pair storage and lookup efficiency.

2. Built-in Functions & Methods
Modern programming languages (like JavaScript, Python, or Java) have powerful built-in tools. We cover how they work "under the hood."
Array Methods: .map(), .filter(), .reduce(), .sort(), and .splice().
String Methods: .split(), .join(), .slice(), and regex basics.
Math: Math.max(), Math.floor(), and handling randomness.

3. Basic Algorithms
Standard patterns every beginner should know.
Searching: Linear search vs. Binary search.
Sorting: Introduction to Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort.
Two Pointers: A common technique for array-based interview questions.

💻 Sample Interview Questions
Each folder contains solutions and complexity analysis for questions like:
Find the maximum and minimum element in an array.
Remove duplicates from a sorted array.
Check if a string is a palindrome using built-in methods.
Determine the "Two Sum" (finding two numbers that add up to a target).

📈 Big O Notation
Every solution in this repo includes a Big O analysis to help you understand performance:
Time Complexity: How fast the code runs as input grows.
Space Complexity: How much memory the code consumes.

🚀 How to Practice
Pick a Topic: Start with Arrays—they are the most common starting point.
Read the 'Method' Section: Before solving a problem, review the built-in functions used in the solution to understand the syntax.
Test Yourself: Try to solve the challenge.js (or .py) file before opening the solution file.
